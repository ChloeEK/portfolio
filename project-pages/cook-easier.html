          <div class="body-text">The main problem I am trying to solve are peoples access to healthy recipes and making those recipes easy to use, visually appealing and allow you to cook at the same time as you follow along with the recipe. </div>
          <div class="body-text">As apps and delivery services become more accessible, the amount of home cooked meals has drastically declined. Simply cooking a majority of your meals at home automatically leads to healthier eating. But access to easy, healthy and step by step recipes is sometimes hard or can cost a significant amount of money. This free app will have simple, easy to use instructions for healthy, tasty meals. It will have step by step instructions, with measurements of each ingredient, so you donâ€™t have to refer back to the ingredient list each step. It will also have the option to listen to the voiced instruction instead of reading it for our auditory learners and pictures for our visual learners. </div>
          <div class="body-text">This application was built with Android Studio using Java. </div>
