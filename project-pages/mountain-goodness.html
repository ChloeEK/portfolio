          <div class="body-text">I approached a small local business called Mountain Goodness in Revelstoke, British Columbia. It is a health food store that has a rewards program for every dollar you spend on supplements. If you spend $200 in supplements, you receive $10 off your next purchase. They currently keep track of the rewards of their customers through hundreds of cue cards. The employee will have to search through cue cards to find the customers name and add the product and price of the supplement. When it looks like the customer has reached around $200, the employee will add everything up manually, record that the $10 has been used and write down the remaining amount. This is very time consuming, hard to read and disorganized. My proposed solution was to create a program that easily lets employees search for a customer, add the product and price of the supplement, and easily see how far away the customer is from the next reward.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Through the use of PHP, HTML and CSS I was able to create a dynamic website that allowed employees to search customers and track all of their purchases and rewards. This also included a customized database using PHPAdmin and MySQL optimized queries. To keep costs as low as possible, I hosted the website through Hostinger, which allowed me to easily maintain the database and secruity.</div>
          <div class="body-text">This application resulted in decreased checkout times and increased validity in product tracking and rewards.</div>
